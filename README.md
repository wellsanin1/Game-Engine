To run, run the exe from here on a windows pc.
https://github.com/wellsanin1/Game-Engine/tree/master/x64/Release

This demonstration includes: Physics including collisions using Bullet3D, Graphics rendering using OGRE, Audio using FMOD studio, Input using SDL and basic network functionality using Enet. To use the network functionality run the exe fromÂ https://github.com/wellsanin1/Game-Engine/tree/master/Server/x64/Debug/ before opening two instances of the engine. Colliding with the cube on the right starts network functionality.
